 * Token buffer specialized for XML documents. Whereas the "plain"
 * {@link TokenBuffer} looks literally for the start and end separators,
 * the XmlTokenBuffer takes as input an element name, and looks for
 * an opening tag that contains this element name, but may also
 * contain additional attributes. For example, the
 * XmlTokenBuffer will correctly locate the token:
 * <pre>
 * &lt;abc attrib="2"&gt;contents&lt;/abc&gt;
 * </pre>
 * when asked to look for "<tt>abc</tt>" (while the standard
 * TokenBuffer will not).
